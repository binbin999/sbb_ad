There are 3 python files for InceptionV4 Finetuning. They are located in this folder.

They are called: inception_v4_02.py, inception_v4_03.py, and inceptionv4_04.py .

In the same directory, you will need to get the images dataset located at:
https://github.com/marciahon29/Ryerson_MRP/tree/master/MRI_32_Images

These images are located under a folder called data_##. Within, there is train.tar.gz and validation.tar.gz . You must extract these.
The final folder structure is:

        data_## :
          train
          validation
          
For the script inception_v4_02.py, you are to use data_02. With inception_v4_03.py, use data_03. With inception_v4_04.py, use data_04.

Also, you must download the imageNet trained weights. Create a folder called: "imagenet_models". Then upload to the folder the following
"h5" files:

    ImageNet Pretrained Weights 
    Theano: https://github.com/kentsommer/keras-inceptionV4/releases/download/2.0/inception-v4_weights_th_dim_ordering_th_kernels.h5
    TensorFlow: https://github.com/kentsommer/keras-inceptionV4/releases/download/2.0/inception-v4_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5
    
You must put all the python, data_##, and imagenet_models at the same level.

To run the program, at command prompt:

python inception_v4_02.py > accuracy_02_100e_8b.txt
python inception_v4_03.py > accuracy_03_100e_8b.txt
python inception_v4_04.py > accuracy_04_100e_8b.txt

*For my home machine, it takes around 3-4 epochs per hour. Thus for 100 epochs, it is a little more than 24 hours.
