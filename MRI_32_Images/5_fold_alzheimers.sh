# This script creates the 5-folds for Alzheimers
#
# Total Alzheimers: 3200, Total NonAlzheimers: 3200
# Total images: 6400
#
# The train/validation division is 80% to 20%
# Meaning test is 2560 images and validation is 640 images for each category
#       * 2560 (train - alzheimers) and 2560 (train - nonalzheiemrs)
#       * 640 (validation - nonalzheimers) and 640 (validation - alzheimers)
#
# This is for 5-fold, therefore, we are creating 5 folders each having 560 images.
# These folders are named: fold_0# and fold_0#, where # is from 0 to 9.
#
# After these 5 folders are done, we join 4 and keep one out for a total of 5 times.
#

# Extract all alzheimer's images from folders
# Put all results into the "alzheimers" folder
# rename the images
