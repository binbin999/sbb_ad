These are 32 MRI images per patient and there are 133 patients used per category.

Therefore, 3200 images are used per category. For a total of 6400 images.

I will be doing 5-fold. This means 5120 train to 1280 validation images in total. With 2560 training and 640 training for each of alzheimers and nonalzheimers.

The images were taken from http://www.oasis-brains.org/ .

The following is how alzheimers and nonalzherimers were classified.
CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating):
-	0 = nondemented
-	0.5 = very mild dementia
-	1 = mild dementia
-	2 = moderate dementia
-	CDR > 0 : probable AD

0 --> non-alzheimers
>0 --> alzheimers

The scripts of "5_fold"* takes the data directly from Alzhermers.zip and NonAlzheimers.zip.
In each directly (once extracted), you run the appropriate script, either 5_fold_alzheimers.sh or 5_fold_nonalzheimers.sh .
Then, you have in a folder the alzheimers and nonalzherimers folders (created from above sentence) and the 5_folds_create_data.sh. This will create the 5-folds: data_00, data_01, data_02, data_03, and data_04.
*Keep in mind that these is done using random numbers. Therefore the splits of the images, will not be the same.

If you would like to download the actual data folders used in this project. Please download the folders: data_00, data_01, data_02, data_03, and data_04. Inside, there are tar.gz for train and validation. Extract these here and remove the *tar.gz files.
