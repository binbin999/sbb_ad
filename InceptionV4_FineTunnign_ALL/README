These are the final results of Finetuning with InceptionV4. (October 1, 2017)

Reference: https://github.com/flyyufelix/cnn_finetune 

You need to create a folder called "imagenet_models". Inside you must have:

1. inception-v4_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5
2. inception-v4_weights_th_dim_ordering_th_kernels.h5

(one is for Tensorflow and the otehr is for Theano).

Also, you must have all of the data folders: data_00, data_01, data_02, data_03, data_04.

Models were created, however, they are too large to upload.
