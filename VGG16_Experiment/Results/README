The results naming convention is as follows:

resutls_d##_e###_b##.txt

d## is the dataset. This can be 00, 01, 02, 03, 04
e### is the number of epochs. Here we have tested with 100 and 150 .
b## is the batch size.


To get a feel for what number of epochs is good, epochs of 100 and 150 were analyzed.

With 100 epochs, the accuracy is : 0.9445
With 140 epochs, the accuracy is : 0.9484
With 150 epochs, the accuracy is : 0.9355

Given these results, my scripts will run for 100 epochs.

Testing folder contains the exploratory results.

Final folder contains the final results.
